## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
- Supabase account
- Google Cloud Platform account (for Vision API)
- OpenAI account (for GPT API)

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Configure the following variables:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUD_FUNCTION_TAG_CLOTHES`: Google Cloud Function endpoint for clothing tagging
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUD_FUNCTION_SUGGEST_OUTFIT`: Google Cloud Function endpoint for outfit suggestions

### 2. Database Setup

The app uses Supabase PostgreSQL with the following main tables:
- `users`: User profiles and metadata
- `clothes`: Clothing items with attributes and image URLs  
- `outfit_suggestions`: AI-generated outfit recommendations

### 3. Installation & Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 4. Cloud Functions Setup

The application requires two Google Cloud Functions:

**Tag Clothes Function** (`/tag-clothes`):
- Accepts image URL
- Uses Google Vision API to analyze clothing
- Returns type, color, and additional tags

**Suggest Outfit Function** (`/suggest-outfit`):
- Accepts user's clothing inventory
- Uses AI logic or OpenAI API
- Returns curated outfit suggestion

## Key Components

### Authentication
- Secure email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- Automatic session management and persistence
- User profile management

### Wardrobe Management
- Photo capture or gallery selection
- Automatic image upload to Supabase Storage
- AI-powered tagging with Google Vision API
- Manual editing of clothing attributes

### Outfit Suggestions
- Context-aware suggestions (casual, work, formal, etc.)
- AI-powered outfit generation
- Outfit history and favorites
- Daily suggestions with refresh capability

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- Clean separation between UI, business logic, and data layers
- Reusable components and hooks
- Type-safe API integration

### Serverless Integration
- All AI processing handled via external Cloud Functions
- Secure API key management
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements

### User Experience
- Optimistic UI updates
- Loading states and error handling
- Smooth transitions and animations

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Components in `/components/` directory
- Business logic in `/services/` directory
- Type definitions in `/types/` directory
- Custom hooks in `/hooks/` directory

### Best Practices
- TypeScript for all components and services
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Responsive design principles
- Performance optimization with lazy loading

## Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
# Web build
npm run build:web

# Mobile builds require Expo Application Services (EAS)
```

### Supabase Configuration
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Configure storage bucket policies
- Set up authentication providers

## Future Enhancements
